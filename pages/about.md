Hi, I am Francesca Morfini. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Psychology at Northeastern University, working with Drs. Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli ([**Massachusetts General Hospital**](https://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/research/precision-psychiatry/team)), Randy Auerbach ([**Columbia University**](https://www.auerbachlab.com/)), and Juliet Davidow ([**Northeastern University**](https://lbdlpsych.sites.northeastern.edu/)).
 
My **research** focuses on applying multimodal neuroimaging techniques (structural and functional MRI) and machine learning to clinical and cognitive neuroscience. 
Specifically, my work aims to better characterize depression and anxiety in adolescents and youth, improve the diagnostic process, and develop novel treatment interventions.
As part of my research, I also study factors that influence the results of MRI studies.

My **background** is in clinical psychology and neuroimaging, with bachelor's and master's degrees in clinical psychology and neuroscience from San Raffaele University (Milan, Italy). I am also a licensed clinical psychologist in Italy.

I am a U.S. resident (Green Card holder) but I am originally from Milan (Italy).
